								<h3 class="major">Research Context</h3>
								<p>The goal of this project was to develop deep learning models that are able to classify
								packets over a network, in particular, a community network. A community network is a 
								low resource network that is not supported by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), but rather
								by the people of the community. Quality of Service (QoS) is very important in any network
								and in might be hard to attain in a community network due to their lack of resources. Therefore,
								they can make use of a real time classifier to know which packets are coming through their network
								and in order to give more resources to packets that may be more prolfic it a given time. This 
								is where deep learning comes into play. We used deep learning to develop models that can classify 
								packets accuraretely, quickly, and efficently in order to suit the needs of a community network.</p>
								<br>
								<h3 class="major">Methodology</h3>
								<p>We individually developed our own deep learning models and tested it agaisnt a common model. This model was 
								a 2d-CNN. The 2d-CNN was accurate but relatively slow. We ran a series of experiments on our models and 
								on the benchmark model comparing accuracy, memory use, and number of packets per second all over different 
								numbers of parameters in our models.</p>
								<br>
								<h3 class="major">Research Questions</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Can we develop models that exhibit accuracy levels similar to the 2d-CNN and that can be used in a community network?</li>
									<li>Can we develop models that are able to classify more packets per second than the 2d-CNN and are able to be used in real time classification?</li>
									<li>Can we develop models that use less memory that the 2d-CNN and are efficient enough to be used in a low resource environment?</li>
								  </ul>

							<article id="preprocessing">
								<h2 class="major">Preprocessing</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/prepro.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 1: Data Collection</h2>
								<p>Data was collected from the Ocean View community network in 2019. These were raw PCAP files that capture network
									traffic to and from the community network. The data was collected ethically.
								</p> 
								<br>
								<h2>Stage 2: Flow Splitting</h2>
								<p>Data was then split into flows using a python utility program called <i>pkt2flow</i>. Flows are aggregations of packets
									that have the same source and destination IP numbers and port numbers. This was used to make the labelling stage smoother
									and more seamless. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/pkt2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 3: Label Flows</h2>
								<p> As the classification step in this project is a supervised learning problem, we will need labels for each packet.
									The raw PCAP files do not come with labels and therefore we needed to find them ourselves. We used a deep packet
									inspection tool called nDPI to label the data that was recently put into flows.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/ndpi.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 4: Extracting the IP Payload</h2>
								<p>We will be using the IP payload as the training data for the models. This involves extracting the IP payload
									for each packet and padding it with 0s if it is not of length 1480. This is to standardise the length of each record
									being fed into the model. Each packet after padding is 1480 bits and 1 label. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/extraction.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 5: Balancing Classes</h2>
								<p>After labelling the packets and extracting the payloads, we discovered that the data was very unbalanced with smoother
								packets being highly overrepresented and some highly underrepresented. Therfore, we decided to get rid of the classes
								that were underrepresented and reduce the overrepresented classes to a maximum of 10000 per class. This left us with a dataset
								of 10 classes with 9000-10000 of each class. This improved training as the model could learn each type of class equally well
								and got rid of any biases due to unbalcned data.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/histo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 6: Train, Test, Validation sets</h2>
								<p>Lastly, the balanced data was then split into train, test and validation sets. We chose a 64% - 16% - 20% split
								for the train, test and validation set respetively. The result of this is the data we will be using to build and evaluate
								our models.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Ryan's Models</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/pca.webp" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Ryan produced a series of semi-supervised models that include a 1d Convolutional Neural Network (1d-CNN), 2d Convolutional Neural Network (2d-CNN)
								and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). Before data was fed into these models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
								was applied to reduce the feature space down from 1480 to 100. PCA reduces the feature space while keeping as much variance
								in the data as possible. The feature reduction
								was to reduce the amount of model parameters which lead to faster classification and less memory used.
							</p>
							<h3 class="major">Experiments</h3>
							<p>The model's hyperparameters were tuned extensively to try and find a hyperparameter combination that led to both fast and accurate models.
							After the hyperparameters were chosen, the experimentation began. The paramater count for each model was varied and tested with test accuracy, 
							packets classified per second, and peak memory usage was recorded for the respective parameter count. This was done for the semi-supervised models
							and the benchmark 2d-CNN.</p>
							<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/Figure_1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>None of the semi-supervised models beat the benchmark 2d-CNN in terms of accuracy. However, the MLP comes the closest
							with a peak accuracy of roughy 90%. This shows the MLPs ability to generalise well.
							The PCA-1d-CNN was the worst peforming model with accuracies up to 84%. 1d-CNNs work specfically well with time-series data
							and due to the fact the data was not in time-series format it did not perform as well. The PCA-2d-CNN reached accuracies
							of up to 88%. The inferior performance to the MLP could be attributed to the fact that it could not learn the spatial
							dependencies in the data with 100 records per feature. This could explain why the benchmark 2d-CNN performs very well but 
							the PCA-2d-CNN does not perform as well.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/Figure_2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>All of the semi-supervised models out-perform the benchmark model in terms of packets classified per second.
							This showed that using PCA to reduce classification time works. 
							The general trend on these graphs was that when parameter size increases packets classified per second decreases.
							This is to be expected as the more parameters, the more operations the model has to do during the forward-pass.
							The PCA-CNN models were able to classify a similar
							amount of packets per second for each paramater size. However, the PCA-MLP out-performed all of the models by a long way.
							This is due to its simpleness and absence of complex mechanisms, unlike the CNN models.</p> 
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/Figure_3.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this graph we see that peak memory usage generally increaes as paramater size increases. All of the models
							had similar results but the MLP was slightly lower than the others in general. All of these memory usages
							are small and should be able to be used on a community network for real time classification.</p>
							<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
							<p>The PCA-MLP is the clear favourite to be used by the community network. It exhibits accuracy of above 90%
							and can classify a very large amount of packets per second. This is perfect for real time classification in a 
							low resource environment. A case can be made for the use of the benchmark 2d-CNN due to its high accuracy. However, 
							due to its low packets classified per second, it is unlikely to work well for real-time classification.</p>

							<p>
								Boitumelo investigated the application of both Stacked Autoencoders (SAEs) and Recurrent Neural Networks 
								(RNNs). The SAE architecture is designed for unsupervised feature reduction by approximating a non-linear 
								function. Its capability to detect patterns within the dataset and generate a more compact representation
								 of the data was leveraged to enhance the performance of the classification task. Two RNN classifiers, a 
								 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were compared for both their 
								 classification effectiveness and computational efficiency.
