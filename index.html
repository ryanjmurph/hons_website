								<h3 class="major">Research Context</h3>
								<p>The goal of this project was to develop deep learning models that are able to classify
								packets over a network, in particular, a community network. A community network is a 
								low resource network that is not supported by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), but rather
								by the people of the community. Quality of Service (QoS) is very important in any network
								and in might be hard to attain in a community network due to their lack of resources. Therefore,
								they can make use of a real time classifier to know which packets are coming through their network
								and in order to give more resources to packets that may be more prolfic it a given time. This 
								is where deep learning comes into play. We used deep learning to develop models that can classify 
								packets accuraretely, quickly, and efficently in order to suit the needs of a community network.</p>
								<br>
								<h3 class="major">Methodology</h3>
								<p>We individually developed our own deep learning models and tested it agaisnt a common model. This model was 
								a 2d-CNN. The 2d-CNN was accurate but relatively slow. We ran a series of experiments on our models and 
								on the benchmark model comparing accuracy, memory use, and number of packets per second all over different 
								numbers of parameters in our models.</p>
								<br>
								<h3 class="major">Research Questions</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Can we develop models that exhibit accuracy levels similar to the 2d-CNN and that can be used in a community network?</li>
									<li>Can we develop models that are able to classify more packets per second than the 2d-CNN and are able to be used in real time classification?</li>
									<li>Can we develop models that use less memory that the 2d-CNN and are efficient enough to be used in a low resource environment?</li>
								  </ul>

						<!-- Preprocessing-->
							<article id="preprocessing">
								<h2 class="major">Preprocessing</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/prepro.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 1: Data Collection</h2>
								<p>Data was collected from the Ocean View community network in 2019. These were raw PCAP files that captured network
									traffic to and from the community network. The data was collected ethically.
								</p> 
								<br>
								<h2>Stage 2: Flow Splitting</h2>
								<p>Data was then split into flows using a python utility program called <i>pkt2flow</i>. Flows are aggregations of packets
									that have the same source and destination IP numbers and port numbers. This was used to make the labelling stage smoother
									and more seamless. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/pkt2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 3: Label Flows</h2>
								<p> As the classification step in this project is a supervised learning problem, we will need labels for each packet.
									The raw PCAP files do not come with labels and therefore we needed to find them ourselves. We used a deep packet
									inspection tool called ,<i>nDPI</i> to label the data that was recently put into flows.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/ndpi.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 4: Extracting the IP Payload</h2>
								<p>We will be using the IP payload as the training data for the models. This involves extracting the IP payload
									for each packet and padding it with 0s if it is not of length 1480. This is to standardise the length of each record
									being fed into the model. Each packet after padding is 1480 bits and 1 label. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/extraction.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 5: Balancing Classes</h2>
								<p>After labelling the packets and extracting the payloads, we discovered that the data was very unbalanced with some
								packet types being highly overrepresented and some highly underrepresented. Therfore, we decided to get rid of the classes
								that were underrepresented and reduce the overrepresented classes to a maximum of 10000 per class with 10 classes. This left us with a dataset
								of 10 classes with 9000-10000 records of each class. This improved training as the model could learn each type of class equally well
								and got rid of any biases due to unbalcned data.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p_images/histo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Stage 6: Train, Test, Validation sets</h2>
								<p>Lastly, the balanced data was then split into train, test and validation sets. We chose a 64% - 16% - 20% split
								for the train, test and validation set respetively. The result of this is the data we will be using to build and evaluate
								our models.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Ryan's Models</h2>
							
							<p>Ryan produced a series of semi-supervised models that include a 1d Convolutional Neural Network (1d-CNN), 2d Convolutional Neural Network (2d-CNN)
								and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). Before data was fed into these models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
								was applied to reduce the feature space down from 1480 to 100 features. PCA reduces the feature space while keeping as much variance
								in the data as possible. The feature reduction
								was to reduce the amount of model parameters which lead to faster classification and less memory usage.
							</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/pca.webp" alt="" /></span>
							<h3 class="major">Experiments</h3>
							<p>The model's hyperparameters were tuned extensively to find a hyperparameter arrangement that led to both fast and accurate models.
							After the hyperparameters were chosen, the experimentation began. The paramater count for each model was varied and test accuracy, 
							packets classified per second, and peak memory usage was recorded for the respective parameter count. This was done for the semi-supervised models
							and the benchmark 2d-CNN.</p>
							<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/Figure_1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>None of the semi-supervised models outperformed the benchmark 2d-CNN in terms of accuracy. However, the MLP comes the closest
							with a peak accuracy of roughy 90%. This shows the MLPs ability to generalise well to data.
							The PCA-1d-CNN was the worst peforming model with an accuracy of up to 84%. 1d-CNNs work specfically well with time-series data
							and due to the fact the data was not in time-series format, it did not perform as well. The PCA-2d-CNN reached accuracies
							of up to 88%. The inferior performance to the MLP could be attributed to the fact that it could not learn the spatial
							dependencies in the data with 100 records per feature. This could explain why the benchmark 2d-CNN performs very well with 1480 features
							because it is able to learn spatial features and 
							the PCA-2d-CNN not performinh as well with 100 features.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/Figure_2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>All of the semi-supervised models out-perform the benchmark model in terms of packets classified per second.
							This showed that using PCA to reduce classification time works well. 
							The general trend on these graphs was that when parameter size increases packets classified per second decreases.
							This is to be expected as the more parameters, the more operations the model has to do during the forward-pass.
							The PCA-CNN models were able to classify a similar
							amount of packets per second for each paramater size. However, the PCA-MLP out-performed all of the models by a long way.
							This is due to its simpleness and absence of complex mechanisms, unlike the CNN models.</p> 
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ryan_models/Figure_3.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this graph we see that peak memory usage generally increaes as paramater size increases. All of the models
							had similar results but the MLP was slightly lower than the others in general. All of these memory usages
							are small and should be able to be used on a community network for real time classification.</p>
							<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
							<p>The PCA-MLP is the clear favourite to be used by the community network. It exhibits accuracy of above 90%
							and can classify a very large amount of packets per second. This is perfect for real time classification in a 
							low resource environment. A case can be made for the use of the benchmark 2d-CNN due to its high accuracy. However, 
							due to its low packets classified per second, it is unlikely to work well for real-time classification.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Boitumelo's Models</h2>

							<p>
								Boitumelo investigated the application of both Stacked Autoencoders (SAEs) and Recurrent Neural Networks 
								(RNNs). The SAE architecture is designed for unsupervised feature reduction by approximating a non-linear 
								function. Its capability to detect patterns within the dataset and generate a more compact representation
								 of the data was leveraged to enhance the performance of the classification task. Two RNN classifiers, a 
								 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were compared for both their 
								 classification effectiveness and computational efficiency.
							</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/tumi_models/AE.png" alt="" /></span>

							<h3 class="major"> Experiments</h3>
							
							<p>
								To evaluate the scalability of our selected AE variant we conducted an experiment to see how its performance varied with changes
								in model complexity. Due to the resource constrained context of our research project it is important that we find exactly
								how far we can constrain the size of the model before sacrificing accuracy.
								This experiment was designed to determine the optimal balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency for our task  
								Additionaly we compared our hybrid models against a 2D-Convolutional Neural Network benchmark model which was found to be most 
								effecive by previous research on the same topic. 
							</p>
							


							<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
							<h4>Accuracy:</h4>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/tumi_models/Accuracy Graph.png">
								
							</span>
							
							<p>	
							Experimentation revealed the GRU to be the most accurate RNN architecture, outperforming the LSTM. However, while RNNs excel at 
							time-series classification, for packet-by-packet classification. Instead, the best performers were the Random Forest and 
							MLP classifiers, which accurately identified patterns in the encoded data. These results showed the AutoEncoder to be compatible 
							compatible with simple statisical classifiers.
							</p>


							<h4>Efficiency:</h4>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/tumi_models/PPS Graph.png">
							</span>
							
							<p>
								Out of all hybrid models the AE- Random Forest model was found to be most efficient. The random forest is a traditional
								statistical method for classification and its simple nature allowed it to outperform all deep larning methods in efficiency.
								The results from this experiment also exposed the poor scalability of the GRU classifier, its extreme computational complexity makes
								it unsuitable for the task of real-time classification. Although the Random Forest outperformed the MLP at classification accuracy
								the model has a fixed number of parameters while the AE-MLP architecture is able to scale much further in complexity. This trait 
								motivated the AE-MLP for use as a candidate model under further investigation. 
							</p>

							<h4>Candidate Model: AE - MLP</h4>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/tumi_models/AE_MLP.png">
							</span>

							<p>
								The AE-MLP had the highest accuracy, and despite being less efficient than the AE-RF, its scalability to over 1 
								million parameters made it worth further investigation. Results showed it as a strong candidate, with an ideal 
								parameter count of around 500,000, where accuracy plateaued above 92% while classifying over 7,000 PPS.
							</p>


							<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
							<p>
								The AutoEncoder-MLP hybrid model is the best performing model from this investigation. It consistently
								achieved an accuracy above 92% and classified above 7000 Packets per second. Although the random forest classifier
								achieved an inrease classification speed, the MLP is more suitable for real-world application due to its accuracy. 

								Further testing using different programming languages on different computational hardware is neccessary to fully 
								measure how suitable this model is for implimentation in a community network. Although the benchmarked 2D-CNN mdoel 
								outperformed our candidate model, the combination fo AutoEncoders with traditional statisical classifiers demostrated
								potential for an extremely efficient model, as seen in the AE-Random Forest hybrid.

							<h2 class="major">Michael's Models</h2>
							<p>
								The Michael's research investigates several types of deep learning models, both simple and hybrid, to understand their effectiveness in traffic classification. The simplest
								models considered are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are basic feedforward neural networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are excellent at capturing
								spatial features from data.
							</p>
							<p>
								Beyond these basic architectures, Michael explores hybrid models that combine CNNs with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated
								Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. These hybrid models are designed to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic data. CNNs handle the spatial aspect recognising
								patterns within the data. While RNNs, particularly LSTM and GRU, focus on the temporal sequences, making them more suited for tasks involving time-based patterns.<ul>
									<li>1D-CNN-LSTM and 1D-CNN-GRU, where 1D-CNN is used for feature extraction, followed by LSTM or GRU layers for sequence learning.</li>
									<li>2D-CNN-LSTM and 2D-CNN-GRU, which are similar but operate on two-dimensional data, making them capable of handling more complex spatial patterns.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/michael_models/Hybrid_model.png" alt=""/></span>
							<h3 class="major">Experiments</h3>
							<p><strong>Classification Accuracy:</strong> This evaluates whether hybrid models improve traffic classification accuracy compared to simpler models. Hybrid models are expected to perform better by leveraging both spatial and temporal features, offering more accurate classifications.</p>
							<p><strong>Real-Time Traffic Classification:</strong> This examines the ability of hybrid models to classify traffic in real-time by measuring their Packet Processing Speed (PPS). The goal is to determine if they can process over 10,000 PPS, which is essential for achieving real-time classification in low-resource networks.</p>
							<p><strong>Memory Efficiency:</strong> This explores how model complexity impacts memory usage. The experiment measures the peak memory consumption for each model and investigates the trade-offs between model size, memory usage, and accuracy. Understanding these trade-offs is critical for deployment in environments with limited resources.</p>
							
							<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/michael_models/Accuracy.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								Hybrid models showed superior accuracy in traffic classification, with 1D-CNN-LSTM and 1D-CNN-GRU achieving 94.3% and 94.21%, respectively. 
								Simpler models like MLP and 1D-CNN reached 85.7% and 92.64%. 
								The 2D-CNN-LSTM and 2D-CNN-GRU also performed well, surpassing 91%. 
								However, accuracy gains plateaued with increased complexity, showing diminishing returns.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/michael_models/PPS.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								For packet processing speed (PPS), MLP was the most efficient, consistently above 16,000 PPS, suitable for real-time use in low-resource environments. 
								1D-CNN and 2D-CNN performed moderately well, staying near the 10,000 PPS threshold. 
								The 2D-CNN-LSTM and 2D-CNN-GRU both started above the 10,000 PPS threshold when their parameter counts were lower, but their performance dropped significantly as the models became more complex
								On the other hand, 1D-CNN-LSTM and 1D-CNN-GRU, struggled to maintain high PPS, making them less viable for real-time applications despite their accuracy.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/michael_models/Mem.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								In terms of memory usage, MLP was the most efficient, using only 0.128 MB, while hybrid models like 2D-CNN-LSTM and 2D-CNN-GRU required up to 0.447 MB. 
								Though hybrids offer higher accuracy, their increased memory requirements may challenge deployment in resource-constrained environments.
							</p>
							<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
							<p>
								Hybrid models such as 2D-CNN-LSTM and 2D-CNN-GRU provided the a good balance between accuracy and performance for lower parameters, while 2D-CNN and 1D-CNN delivered strong overall results depending on the specific requirements. 
								MLP offered the best real-time performance and memory efficiency, albeit with lower accuracy.
								Future research should focus on optimising hybrid models for real-time use and exploring lightweight architectures like MobileNet to enhance efficiency. Further testing across diverse datasets and networks is necessary to assess scalability and adaptability.
